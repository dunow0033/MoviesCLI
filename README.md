# MovieTimes

This app gives trivia about movie titles that the user enters

## Installation

  Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
    gem 'movie-times'

  And then:

  1.  clone github repository
  2.  run "bundle install"
  3.  run "ruby/bin/movie-times"

## Usage

when running the app, enter a movie title at the first prompt.  You will get a response giving you four bits of movie trivia.  You will then be asked
if you want some additional movie trivia.  You can enter 'y' to get the next bit of movie trivia or 'n' to enter a different movie.  At this prompt,
if you enter an invalid response, you will be taken back to the beginning of the app and asked to enter a different movie title.  If you hit 'y',
you will be taken back to the beginning to be asked for a different movie title again, and the process starts all over again.  If you hit 'q' at either
prompt where you are asked for a movie title, you will exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
